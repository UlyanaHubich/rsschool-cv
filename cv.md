### MY LIFE:
At the heart of my philosophy of life are 3 principles.  
_1.“Carpe diem” (*Лови момент*)_   
Feel the moment, live your life extraordinary. Acutely feel life, enjoy what is happening to you, look for new opportunities, never stop.   
_2. "In order to receive something, you need to give something." (*Чтобы что-то получать, нужно что-то отдавать*)_   
Only giving something away (knowledge, experience, energy, communication, motivation, ...) will you receive something in return (resource, self-realization, forward movement, new opportunities, interesting acquaintances, ...)   
_3. "Let others be different." (*Позволь другим быть другими*)_    
Allowing people to be themselves, learn to interact with them and then you will become a great team. Everyone can contribute to the common cause if you learn to accept his strengths and not respond to weaknesses.  
     
__My biggest desire is to constantly be in development. Go ahead. Get a new experience. Discover new facets. Never stop.__
